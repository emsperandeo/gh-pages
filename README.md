Week one:

This week I wrote my HTML and JavaScript in the format of my food quiz project. I haven't plugged in any legitimate information or photos yet. What's on the page are just spot-holders. When we talked in class on Tuesday we discussed the quiz would be layed out, and you had said to just start with one question. I tried to work ahead and write all four quiz questions, but I struggled a bit with finding a good way to hide quiz questions in sections so that they appear one after the other while still providing feedback. I am hoping to figure this out by Tuesday. Everything else we discussed is done, and next week I will plug in my research and the remaining 3 questions.

I placed some place-holder photos in there where I will add photography of vegan meals, etc to provide for the quiz-takers so that it's not just plain text.

I watched a few tutorials and read a few articles pertaining to what I couldn't get to work this week.

None of them gave me a straightforward example of what I was trying to accomplish so I couldn't figure it out this week. I'm sure it's simple, but I am still having a hard time with jQuery.

I was pleased with how simple it was to plug in photos to my JavaScript. It took me a couple days to figure out all of the little details I needed with my interactive format, but I finally got the first question down at least.
