This week I wrote my HTML and JavaScript in the format of my food quiz project. I haven't plugged in any legitimate information or photos yet. What's on the page are just spot-holders. 

I struggled a bit with finding a good way to hide quiz questions so that they appear one after the other while still providing feedback. I am hoping to figure this out by Tuesday. Everything else we discussed is done, and next week I will plug in my research and the remaining 3-4 questions.
