Week one:

This week I wrote my HTML and JavaScript in the format of my food quiz project. I haven't plugged in any legitimate information or photos yet. What's on the page are just spot-holders. When we talked in class on Tuesday we discussed the quiz would be layed out, and you had said to just start with one question. I tried to work ahead and write all four quiz questions, but I struggled a bit with finding a good way to hide quiz questions in sections so that they appear one after the other while still providing feedback. I am hoping to figure this out by Tuesday. Everything else we discussed is done, and next week I will plug in my research and the remaining 3 questions.

I placed some place-holder photos in there where I will add photography of vegan meals, etc to provide for the quiz-takers so that it's not just plain text.

I watched a few tutorials and read a few articles pertaining to what I couldn't get to work this week.

None of them gave me a straightforward example of what I was trying to accomplish so I couldn't figure it out this week. I'm sure it's simple, but I am still having a hard time with jQuery.

I was pleased with how simple it was to plug in photos to my JavaScript. It took me a couple days to figure out all of the little details I needed with my interactive format, but I finally got the first question down at least.

Week two:

This week I researched all of my quiz material and plugged in all of the information. I also finished the rest of my questions in javascript and figured out all of the issues I had with hiding and showing my questions one at a time. I added jQuery for interactivity.

I am, however, having issues with where to plug in my image attribution in javascript and how to format it since it's not in my HTML. I'm also having issues figuring out how to add a hyperlink in my JavaScript because i'm not sure how to format that as well. I will work on this over the weekend and in class on Tuesday.
